  design_requirements:
  - The underscore diacritic (U+0331) for lowercase <g̱> may either cross the descender below the baseline or appear entirely below the descender. It should not intersect the bowl of <g>. Positioning below the descender is more common but may cause it to become invisible if interline spacing (leading) is small or zero.
  - The <Ḵ> and <ḵ> may be either precomposed characters (U+1E34 and U+1E35) or the base characters <K> and <k> with the underscore diacritic (U+0331). Both should be supported as they may both be used in the same text. Same for the auxiliary <Ḻ>, <Ṉ>, etc.
  - The period (U+002E) is used both as a letter and as punctuation. As a letter it indicates glottal stop [ʔ] and occurs either at the beginning or in the middle of a word. As punctuation it appears only at the end of a word. Spacing and kerning should be sensitive to these different contexts. Vertical position is the same in both cases.
  - The letter apostrophe <ʼ> distinguishes ejective sounds like <Tʼ> /tʼ/ from non-ejective sounds like <T> /tʰ/ and is not punctuation. It should be represented by U+02BC which is specified by Unicode as a letter (character class Lm). It is sometimes instead represented by U+0027 or U+2019 but these should be reserved for punctuation (Unicode character classes Po and Pi). Some fonts kern or vertically position U+02BC differently from U+2019 to distinguish them in text.
  - The auxiliary letters <Y̱> and <Ɏ> are obsolete, having been replaced by <Ÿ> in the 1980s, but are present in older texts.

  - The ogonek diacritic (U+0328) is used for nasalization (compare e.g. Navajo) and may be combined with any of the acute, grave, or circumflex diacritics on a single vowel character. Combinations may be in either the order base + ogonek + diacritic or the order base + diacritic + ogonek. Positioning of the ogonek generally follows the practice for European languages like Polish and Lithuanian in being attached to the base character on the right for <Ą>, <ą>, <ę>, <ų> etc.
